    <p>Bitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, created in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on a decentralized peer-to-peer network without the need for intermediaries.</p>
    <p>Bitcoin blockchain is only used to store and transfer Bitcoin and doesn't have an execution layer.</p>
    <p>It creates two issues:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It's not possible to build DeFi on Bitcoin</li>
        <li>It's not possible to build a trully decentralized bridge on Bitcoin</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thus, we have a lot of various BTC flavors on different blockchains.</p>
    <p>Providing an overview of all of those BTC flavors is a puprose of this map.</p>
