    <p>Babylon is a protocol that allows users to stake their BTC and earn rewards.</p>
    <p>It's similar to restaking protocols (your assets are used to secure other networks), but it's not restaking since BTC is not staked before staking with Babylon.</p>
    <p>Babylon rewards are usually paid in non-BTC assets.</p>
    <p>There are several liquid staking protocols on top of Babylon.</p>
